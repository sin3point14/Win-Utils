# Win-Utils
A C# based Windows Forms project which shall aim to add simple utilities and simplified interaction with wsl through a Tasktray App.

### Plan:

WSL:

- Kill distros with a click 
- Launch windows terminal directly with a distro in focus

Non WSL:

- Save an image in clipboard to file(useful with win + shift + S)
- Kill Discord/FIrefox with a click
- start a socks proxy in WSL

Add keyboard shortcuts, perhaps relevant to me: https://www.sparxeng.com/blog/software/capturing-keypress-windows-message-filter
